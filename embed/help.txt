    This program has been created in the aim to more easily modify
    the Team Fortress 2 mod "no hats mod".


# Presentation #

    The program looks for a configuration file named "config.txt" in
    the same directory it's in.
    
    It also looks for a database file named "database.txt" in the
    same location.
    
    It will parse a folder named "input" to get the files referenced
    in the database.
    
    The parameters of the configuration file will be read at startup
    and the program will copy files to the "output" folder based on
    the instructions it found.


    The instructions that can be written in the config file:

    - A cosmetic item
    - An update
    - An equip region
    - A class
    - A (KEEP) or (REMOVE) flag


# Errors #

    A (REMOVE) or (KEEP) flag has been ignored as it's been already
    set.
    
        This is to tell you that your config file has more than one
        flag in it.
        
    Unknown parameter!
    
        A parameter in the config file is not recognized, the
        program will ignore it.
        
    Warning: The database doesn't contain a path for:
    "[nameOfCosmetic]"
    
        The database contains this for every hat:
        "PATH=(somePathHere)". In this instance, there is no path
        between the "()". This is likely a database error.
        
    Error: "[somePathHere]": this path doesn't exist.
    
        The path in the database leads to nothing. There is likely
        an error in the database.
        
    Error: "[somePathHere]": the pattern search "[aPatternHere]"
    retreived 0 results.
    
        The program tried to scan the given path with the given
        pattern, but hasn't found any match. There is maybe an
        error in the database or the file doesn't exist in the
        input folder.
